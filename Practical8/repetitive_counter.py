# Pseudocode:
# Import the necessary libraries
# Define a string of DNA sequences containing repeated elements
# Use a regular expression to find overlapping repetitive sequence elements
# Count and print the total number of duplicate elements found

# Import the necessary library for regular expressions
import regex

# Define the DNA sequence string
seq = "ATGCAATCGGTGTGTCTGTTCTGAGAGGGCCTAA"

# Use regex to find all overlapping instances of the repetitive sequences 'GTGTGT' or 'GTCTGT'
# The 'overlapped=True' parameter is used to ensure that overlapping instances are counted
n = regex.findall('GTGTGT|GTCTGT', seq, overlapped=True)

# Print the total number of repetitive elements found
# This will be the length of the list 'n', which contains all matches of the repetitive sequences
print(len(n))
