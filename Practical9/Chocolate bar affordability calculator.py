# Pseudocode:
# Define a function named 'Chocolate_bar_affordability_calculator' that takes two parameters:
# 'total_money' which is the total amount of money the user has, and
# 'price' which is the cost of a single chocolate bar.
# The function calculates the maximum number of chocolate bars that can be purchased
# and the remaining change after the purchase.
# Use floor division to determine how many full chocolate bars can be bought.
# Use the modulo operator to find the remainder of the money after the purchase.
# Return both the number of chocolate bars that can be bought and the remaining change.

def Chocolate_bar_affordability_calculator(total_money, price):
    """
    Calculate the affordability of chocolate bars based on total money and price per bar.
    
    Parameters:
    total_money (int or float): The total amount of money the user has.
    price (int or float): The cost of a single chocolate bar.

    tuple: A tuple containing two elements:
            - bars (int): The number of chocolate bars that can be bought.
            - change (int or float): The remaining money after the purchase.
    """
    # Calculate the number of whole chocolate bars that can be bought
    bars = total_money // price
    
    # Calculate the remaining money after attempting to buy the chocolate bars
    change = total_money % price
    
    # Return the number of bars and the change as a tuple
    return bars, change

# Example usage of the function:
# Call the function with a total money amount of 100 and a price of 7 per chocolate bar
# Print the result which will be a tuple containing the number of bars and the change
print(Chocolate_bar_affordability_calculator(100, 7))
