When run Alignment.py, the result is

SLC6A4_HUMAN
SLC6A4_MOUSE
BLOSUM score: 3137.0
percentage identity: 92.53968253968254 %
SLC6A4_HUMAN
SLC6A4_RAT
BLOSUM score: 3107.0
percentage identity: 91.74603174603175 %
SLC6A4_MOUSE
SLC6A4_RAT
BLOSUM score: 3261.0
percentage identity: 96.82539682539682 %

The greater the BLOSUM score is, the more similar their sequences are.
So according to BLOSUM scores and percentage identity, human SLC6A4 gene sequence is more like the mouse than the rat.
Mouse is a better model organism for studying variation in the SLC6A4 gene in humans.
