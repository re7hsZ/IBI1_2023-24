When run Alignment.py, the result is

SLC6A4_HUMAN
SLC6A4_MOUSE
BLOSUM score: 3137.0
percentage identity: 92.53968253968254 %

SLC6A4_HUMAN
SLC6A4_RAT
BLOSUM score: 3107.0
percentage identity: 91.74603174603175 %

SLC6A4_MOUSE
SLC6A4_RAT
BLOSUM score: 3261.0
percentage identity: 96.82539682539682 %

The higher the BLOSUM score, the more similar their sequences are. 
So based on the BLOSUM scores and percentage identity, the human SLC6A4 gene sequence is more like that of mice than rats. 
Therefore, mice make a better model organism for studying variations in the SLC6A4 gene in humans.
