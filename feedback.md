In Practical3, there were no edits suggested.
In Practical4, d and e should not have been hardcoded, wrong code for w and wrong explanation.
So, I made the following changes:
1. Calculate the time improvement, making it not just being hardcoded.
2. Right code for w, making W only be true when one of X and Y is true.
3. I have	used	pseudocode	to	plan	and	comment	my	project.
In Practical6, I was told to write more about my code.
So, I add some comments about my code.
